            Now if i track my progress regrading GSOC 2025. I have selected seven potential origination in which i can contribute still it is high and eventually i will filter it out to three (max). Although i had created several project and i am one of the best in my class in term of programming it still pretty tough for me to understand the issues and then fix them. Before it i was thinking i myself as an genius now i know i am not more than an fool. It gonna have fun honestly i am nervous also another reason is i didn't have any person whom i am talk about this people around me in the college are just care about their mark and getting an job not how to learn and do some crazy things.
            </p>
            <p>
            One Thing I get to know that it's not enough for a programmer just to code structuring it and maintaining it in a proper and efficient way is as important as coding I know how to code but when I go to the GitHub pages of these organizations they have proper and well maintained code which I am surprised to see because I have not worked like that before I have worked mostly alone and learned from myself and from the Internet so I do not know how to do that.
