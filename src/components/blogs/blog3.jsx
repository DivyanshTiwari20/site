            <p>
            It's 4 of jan 2025 i am thinking to take part in google summer of code I don't know much about it last year I heard of it but at that time already late. So this year I'm trying to part in it. Although I am late again it's January and people start preparing for it from November and December(i heard on internet) although the official date haven't arrived yet of selected Organizations. I had selected some them that take part in it frequently. And now I will look for their codes and after few understanding I will try to start contributing and fixing issues on their GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
            And let's see what happens as i am new and not familiar with open source and how the contributions works. Till date I have only used Github just for pushing my code. It will going to be very new experience. So now it's time to push our boundaries and go out of your comfort zone to try something NEW!!
