            <p>
              Are you an hardworking person Congratulations you're gonna be the
              top 90% people in the world but what if you want to be the top 1%.
              What's the difference? First of all i didn't think most of the
              people put effort for their goal (Including me). And also they
              want to be successful very fast. And if some do hard work still
              many of them didn't become what they want to be. What i think of
              is that the only difference between top 10% and top 1% is the
              touch of madness.. So if you want to top 10% in the world be
              hardworking and focus but if you want to be the top 1% them be a
              Mad.
